# TypeScript Instructions for Ganglia

## Code Style & Standards
- Use strict TypeScript configuration with `strict: true`
- Prefer explicit type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions and computed types
- Use `const assertions` for readonly arrays and objects where appropriate
- Prefer `async/await` over `.then()` for promises
- Use descriptive variable and function names that reflect their purpose
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
